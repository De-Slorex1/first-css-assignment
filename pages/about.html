        The Mission of CapacityBay, Inc. is simple: build the capacity of U. S. Veterans, transitioning service members, New Americans, immigrants, refugees as well as others living in areas of substantial unemployment and technology deprived communities such as sub-Sahara Africa and other parts of the world.

        Our vision is not only to create information technology jobs and careers for people in transition and poverty but to facilitate economic and social opportunity for them and their families.

        At CapacityBay, Inc., we embrace and foster the following core values which also values reflect and support our mission: Hard work, Punctuality, Respect, Cooperation and collaboration, Partnership, Diversity, Tolerance, Teamwork, Research, Equity.
